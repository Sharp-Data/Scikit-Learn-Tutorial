# Project: Scikit-Learn Tutorial


### Overview

The Python programming language is a great option for data science and predictive analytics, as it comes equipped with multiple packages which cover most of your data analysis needs. For machine learning in Python, Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a great option and is built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib (N-dimensional arrays, scientific computing, and data visualization respectively).
In this tutorial, you'll see how you can easily load in data from a database with sqlite3, how you can explore your data and improve its data quality with pandas and matplotlib, and how you can then use the Scikit-Learn package to extract some valid insights out of your data.

## [Part 1: Predicting MLB Team Wins per Season](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-tutorial-baseball-1)

In this project, youâ€™ll test out several machine learning models from sklearn to predict the number of games that a Major-League Baseball team won that season, based on the teams statistics and other variables from that season.  The following scikit-learn models are featured in this project:

- K-means clustor
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression

### Results

The Ridge Regression model predicted team wins with an absolute mean error of 2.673 wins per season


## [Part II: Predicting Hall of Fame Careers](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-tutorial-baseball-2)

In this project, you'll see how to use classification models to predict which players will be voted into the MLB Hall of Fame.  The following scikit-learn models are featured in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

##### Link: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-tutorial-baseball-2

### Results

The Random Forest model predicted 50 of 61 (82%) Hall of Fame careers with only 2 false positives out of 6,239 total players.
